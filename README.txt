2. Please note - these programs take a while to load. The longest ones are the mcf programs just because it has 700,000 lines of instructions. They take around 5 minutes for my program to process the files. The reason for that is because in an effort to keep track of all the addresses, I just append them to an array, and I perform linear search on them to compare for compulsory misses.

3. Also, I implemented the cache simulator by first simulating a fully associative cache, and then using the hit/miss return type in the real world cache. For both of them, I use a 2-D array to keep track of valid, dirty, and tag bits. I also perform linear search on the number of ways, which may worsen to programâ€™s elapsed time.

4. My FIFO replacement policy resembles a queue.
